= JupyterLab

We'll start JupyterLab on a VM outside of a Kubernetes cluster.   

== Start JupyterLab

JupyterLab has already been installed on your VM. You just need to run the following commands to start it.

. Start JupyterLab

+
image::local/rhel9-terminal.png[Open terminal,100%,100%]

+
[source,bash]
----
source /home/developer/venv/elyra/bin/activate
jupyter lab
----

+ 
image::local/rhel9-terminal-jupyter.png[Command to open jupyter from terminal,100%,100%]

+
NOTE: You can copy commands to the clipboard icon to the left menu as shown in the screenshot above. You can also move the left menu handler by dragging it up or down. After pasting command the command to the clipboard you can paste into a terminal by right clicking and selecting Paste. When you are in the web browser you can paste by using Ctrl-v.

. After running the command JupyterLab should startup in Firefox.

+

. Click on the Git icon on the left menu and click *Clone a repository*.

+ 
image::local/jupyter-git-clone.png[Button to clone a Git repository,100%,100%]

. Clone the https://github.com/jhurlocker/elyra_docling_rh_summit.git repo.

+
image::local/git-clone1.png[Box to clone a Git repository,100%,100%]

+
Clone the https://github.com/noelo/instruct-generate repo as well.

+ 
image::local/git-clone2.png[Box to clone a Git repository,100%,100%]

+
You should now see the *elyra_docling_rh_summit* and *instruct_generate* directories in the file browser.

== Elyra Pipeline

. Open the *docling_elyra_summit.pipeline* file under */elyra_docling_rh_summit/local_development*.

+
First we'll ingest 3 files from the files directory. Then we'll converter those files into markdown files using docling. Once the markdown files are combined we'll need to manually review them to make sure the content is of high quality. Once the file is ready we'll rename it to move the pipeline to the QNA Generator node to generate the qna.yaml file. Finally we'll need to review the contents of the qna.yaml file to ensure it is ready for InstructLab.

+ 
image::local/docling-elyra-pipeline.png[Elyra pipeline,100%,100%]

. Click on the *Ingest Files* node of the Elyra pipeline. Select the *Open Panel* in the top right hand corner.

+
After opening the panel take a look at the node properties that are available. Elyra provides a lot of flexibility and configuration of nodes within a pipeline. Every node requires 2 properties, Filename and Runtime Image. 

+ 
The Filename property contains a reference to the *copy_files.py* we have under */elyra_docling_rh_summit/local_development*.

+ 
The Runtime Image we are using for local development is the Anaconda with Pyrhon image. Elyra allows you to run different images for any of your nodes. For instance, some nodes in your pipeline may require a GPU while others can run with a CPU. This helps to save valuable compute resources.

+

. Hovering the mouse pointer over a node shows some of the node properties. Double click on the *PDF Converter* node to open the *injest-local.ipynb* notebook.

. TODO - WE NEED TO HAVE THEM REVIEW IMPORTANT CELLS OF NOTEBOOK AND ENTER IN THE PODMAN AI LAB INFERENCE URL.

== HITL Markdown

. Click on the *HITL Markdown* node.

[source,bash]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----
+ 
NOTE: The `bastion` system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, and when you built the previous container, you used the UBI9 image. This means both the image and the container were built off the same Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages. 

. As we did previously in this lab, Use `buildah from` to pull down the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 UBI.

+
[source,bash]
----
buildah from registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
----

NOTE: Because you already pulled one image named `ubi-working-container` this one is called `ubi-working-container-1`. 

[#prerequisites]
== Install Prerequisites

Now that you have a working container, you will use the same process as before installing all the prerequisites, changing config files, and manipulating the contents of this container to be in the desired state.

The software you will install is a JavaScript-based game that runs on a web browser. As before in the lab, use dnf to install software inside the container. 

. Use `buildah run` and install Apache (`httpd`) into the `ubi-working-container-1` container. 
+
[source,bash]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container-1 -- dnf -y install httpd
----

== Enable Service

The next thing to do is to use a systemctl to enable the service. The ubi-init provides full systemd service to the container.
This will start up any of the services that are enabled. 

. Enable the `httpd` service using `buildah run`

+
[source,bash]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container-1 -- systemctl enable httpd
----

NOTE: The UBI standard image doesn't have systemd installed on it by default. The `ubi-init` container image does include systemd. Plan accordingly to which image you use to build applications.  

== Explore Source Materials

A GitHub repository has already been synchronized to `/home/devops/clumsy-bird/` This repository contains the configurations for your application.

. Verify the repository is cloned inside the `/home/devops/` directory
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /home/devops/
----

+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/ellisonleao/clumsy-bird
----
+
NOTE: The output states that the software has already been checked out. 
+
. Explore the JavaScript contents, index files, and everything else that we need for this web-based JavaScript software.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ls clumsy-bird
----

== Add Source Materials to Container

. Now that you have verified the source materials exist, you will put the software inside of my container image using the `buildah copy` command.
+
[source,bash]
----
buildah copy ubi-working-container-1 clumsy-bird /var/www/html
----

[#container]
== Enable Container in Background

In the previous section of this lab, you ran the game natively through interactive mode. Because you are now building a web application you will need to run the container in the background and access it through a web address. 

. Execute `buildah config` to specify a port and initialize the container. 

+
[source,bash]
----
buildah config --port 80 --cmd "/usr/sbin/init" ubi-working-container-1
----

NOTE: The command makes a configuration change to this container. I'm configuring this container to accept connections to its port 80. When the container starts up, it should run the init command, which, in this case, is going to be the Apache daemon right from earlier when I enabled it.

== Commit Container and Deploy

. Now that we have a container in a working configured state, it is time to make that permanent by committing it to a container image called `clumsy-bird`
+
[source,bash]
----
buildah commit ubi-working-container-1 clumsy-bird
----

. Verify that the image was created with `podman`
+
[source,bash]
----
podman images
----
+
. Run the container Now it's time to run the container. 
+
[source,bash]
----
podman run -d -p 8500:80 clumsy-bird
----

== Verify Application

Verify that the application is running by navigating to
